Code for tutorial taught at the [CWI masterclass](https://www.cwi.nl/en/events/masterclass-ci-12-13-may-2022/ ).

The tutorial contains:
- Pretrained GAN and WGAN weights
- Minimal setup for training and testing a GAN and WGAN on MNIST
- Minimal setup for solving inverse problems using (Markov chain generative adversarial neural networks for solving Bayesian inverse problems in physics applications for inverse problems)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122123003280]
